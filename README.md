# Wide Twitch Clips
I dont know what twitch was thinking making so much empty space on clips player page. This small extension fixes that.
Basically, it makes [this](https://i.imgur.com/4kc82v4.jpg) look like [that](https://i.imgur.com/TAMfXSN.jpg).

Installation
------
There is 2 different ways to use this.
# Userscript (any browser, easy and preferred)
If you never used userscripts before i recommend you reading this [Userscript Beginners HOWTO](https://openuserjs.org/about/Userscript-Beginners-HOWTO) first.
1. Make sure you have [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) installed (or any other userscripts extension).
2. Open [openuserjs.org/scripts/efOne/Wide_Twitch_Clips](https://openuserjs.org/scripts/efOne/Wide_Twitch_Clips).
3. On that page click "Install".
4. Profit.
*All credit for userscript goes to [**camjac251**](https://github.com/camjac251) which he published [here](https://github.com/FiNEk/wide-twitch-clips/issues/1)*

# Chrome Extension (with Devmode enabled)
1. Download and save anywhere you want.
2. Open link - [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions)
3. Enable developer mode ([screenshot](https://developer.chrome.com/static/images/get_started/load_extension.png)).
4. Press LOAD UNPACKED.
5. Profit.

F.A.Q.
------
- #### Why such complicated installation, isnt it easier to upload it to chrome webstore?
Yes, its easier. But chrome webstore makes you pay 5$ for verification. Because im very poor and mainly i made this for myself im not going to do that yet.
- #### Developer mode installation? You surely want to steal my credit card!
~~There is 0 javascript. Whole extenstion is 10 lines of css.~~
Now there is Userscript available, but its short and straight to the point. It's safe, you can check it out youself.
