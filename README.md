# Wide Twitch Clips
I dont know what twitch was thinking making so much empty space on clips player page. This small extension fixes that.
Basically, it makes [this](https://i.imgur.com/4kc82v4.jpg) look like [that](https://i.imgur.com/TAMfXSN.jpg).

Installation
------

3. Paste it into chrome search bar.
4. Enable developer mode ([screenshot](https://developer.chrome.com/static/images/get_started/load_extension.png)).
5. Press LOAD UNPACKED.
6. Profit.

F.A.Q.
------
- #### Why such complicated installation, isnt it easier to upload it to chrome webstore?
Yes, its easier. But chrome webstore makes you pay 5$ for verification. Because im very poor and mainly i made this for myself im not going to do that yet.
- #### Developer mode installation? You surely want to steal my credit card!
There is 0 javascript. Whole extenstion is 10 lines of css.
